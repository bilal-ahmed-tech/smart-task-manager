## 🧠 Key Concepts & Architecture

### State Management

- **Context API** for centralized task state management
- **TaskContext** provider wrapping the entire application
- Efficient state updates with reducer-like pattern
- No prop drilling across component hierarchy

### Custom Hooks

- **`useTaskStats`** — Calculates task statistics (total, completed, pending, in-progress)
- Memoized calculations for performance optimization
- Returns stats object with count data

### Service Layer

- **`taskService.js`** — Encapsulates task operations:
  - `getTasks()` - Retrieve all tasks from localStorage
  - `addTask()` - Create new task
  - `updateTask()` - Modify existing task
  - `deleteTask()` - Remove task
  - `searchTasks()` - Filter tasks by text
  - `filterByStatus()` - Filter by status type
  - `sortByDueDate()` - Sort task chronologically

### Component Architecture

- **Layout Components** — Navbar, MainLayout for consistent structure
- **UI Components** — Reusable Button, Badge, StatCard components
- **Page Components** — Full-page views (Dashboard, Tasks, AddTask, etc.)
- **Form Components** — TaskForm for creation and editing with validation

### Performance Optimization

- `React.useMemo` — Prevent unnecessary calculations
- `React.useCallback` — Stable function references
- Lazy useState initializer — Defer initial state computation
- Component memoization — Prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Data Persistence

- localStorage automatically saves task changes
- Sync across browser tabs/windows
- Recovery from accidental deletions with undo feature
- Efficient data serialization/deserialization
